			<p>
				Founded in November of 2016 and based in the zombie infested town of Sheffield, UK, Haunted BnB is a scary community marketplace for the last people on Earth to list, discover, and book haunted accommodations around the world â€”primarily online , but we will get to a functioning app on mobile phone or tablet soon!

				Whether a murder scene for a night, a for derelict apartment a week, or a haunted castle for a month, Haunted BnB connects remaining survivors to spooky travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 34,000 cities and 191 countries. And with the World's worst customer service, but an ever growing community of vampires, warewolves and zombies, Haunted BnB is the easiest way for disturbed people to monetize their unholy space and showcase it to an audience of millions.
